        "--  \n",
        "A parameter is a variable in a machine learning model that the algorithm learns from the data during training. For example, in linear regression, the weights (coefficients) are parameters that are adjusted to minimize the error between predictions and actual values.\n",

        "**2. What is correlation?**  \n",
